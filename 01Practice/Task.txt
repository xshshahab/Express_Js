Designing Rest Api - JSON.

GET /users -> Html Document render

GET /api/users -> List all users
GET /api/users/{id} -> Get user by id

POST /api/users -> Create new user

PATCH /api/users/{id} -> Edit the user by id

DELETE /api/users/{id} -> Delete the user by id

NOTE : I'm using [mockaroo] for generating dummy data for simplicity.
